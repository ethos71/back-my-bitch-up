# Robot Memory System

This folder contains documentation that serves as "memory" for AI agents working on this project.

## Purpose

All new documentation should be placed here to provide context and history for AI assistants. This ensures:
- Consistent behavior across sessions
- Preservation of decisions and rationale
- Quick reference for project-specific conventions
- Historical context for future changes

## Organization

- `README.md` - This file, explains the memory system
- `decisions.md` - Record of architectural and design decisions
- `procedures.md` - Standard operating procedures and workflows
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- Additional topic-specific documents as needed

## Usage Guidelines

**When to add documentation here:**
- After implementing new features or workflows
- When solving complex problems (document the solution)
- When establishing new conventions or patterns
- When making architectural decisions

**Document format:**
- Use clear, concise Markdown
- Include dates for time-sensitive information
- Add examples where helpful
- Link to related files/scripts in the repo

## Integration with Agents

The agent configuration (`.github/agents/back-my-bitch-up.md`) and system prompt (`.github/prompts/back-my-bitch-up.md`) reference this folder as the source of truth for project memory and conventions.
